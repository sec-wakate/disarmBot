            "I00084 Russia turns its diplomats into disinformation warriors",
            "“[Russia’s social media] reach isn't the same as Russian state media, but they are trying to recreate what RT and Sputnik had done,\" said one EU official involved in tracking Russian disinformation. \"It's a coordinated effort that goes beyond social media and involves specific websites.\" “Central to that wider online playbook is a Telegram channel called Warfakes and an affiliated website. Since the beginning of the conflict, that social media channel has garnered more than 725,000 members and repeatedly shares alleged fact-checks aimed at debunking Ukrainian narratives, using language similar to Western-style fact-checking outlets.” In this example a Telegram channel (T0043.001: Use Encrypted Chat Apps) was established which presented itself as a source of fact checks (T0097.203: Fact Checking Organisation Persona)."
