            "I00074 The Tactics & Tropes of the Internet Research Agency",
            "“A few press investigations have alluded to the [Russia’s Internet Research Agency]’s job ads. The extent of the human asset recruitment strategy is revealed in the organic data set. It is expansive, and was clearly a priority. Posts encouraging Americans to perform various types of tasks for IRA handlers appeared in Black, Left, and Right-targeted groups, though they were most numerous in the Black community. They included: - Requests for contact with preachers from Black churches (Black_Baptist_Church) - Offers of free counsellingcounseling to people with sexual addiction (Army of Jesus) - Soliciting volunteers to hand out fliers - Soliciting volunteers to teach self-defense classes - Offering free self-defense classes (Black Fist/Fit Black) - Requests for followers to attend political rallies - Requests for photographers to document protests - Requests for speakers at protests - Requests to protest the Westborough Baptist Church (LGBT United) - Job offers for designers to help design fliers, sites, Facebook sticker packs - Requests for female followers to send photos for a calendar - Requests for followers to send photos to be shared to the Page (Back the Badge) - Soliciting videos for a YouTube contest called “Pee on Hillary” - Encouraging people to apply to be part of a Black reality TV show - Posting a wide variety of job ads (write for BlackMattersUS and others) - Requests for lawyers to volunteer to assist with immigration cases”  This behaviour matches T0097.106: Recruiter Persona because the threat actors are presenting tasks for their target audience to complete in the style of a job posting (even though some of the tasks were presented as voluntary / unpaid efforts), including calls for people to attend political rallies (T0126.001: Call to Action to Attend)."
