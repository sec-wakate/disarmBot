# Technique T0099: Impersonate Existing Entity

* **Summary**: An influence operation may prepare assets impersonating existing entities (both organisations and people) to further conceal its network identity and add a layer of legitimacy to its operation content. Existing entities may include authentic news outlets, public figures, organisations, or state entities. 

Users will more likely believe and less likely fact-check news from recognisable sources rather than unknown sites. 

An influence operation may use a wide variety of cyber techniques to impersonate a legitimate entity’s website or social media account. 

This Technique was previously called Prepare Assets Impersonating Legitimate Entities.
