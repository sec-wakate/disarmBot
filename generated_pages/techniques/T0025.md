# Technique T0025: Generate information pollution

* **Summary**: Flood social channels; drive traffic/engagement to all assets; create aura/sense/perception of pervasiveness/consensus (for or against or both simultaneously) of an issue or topic. "Nothing is true, but everything is possible." Akin to astroturfing campaign.

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA06
