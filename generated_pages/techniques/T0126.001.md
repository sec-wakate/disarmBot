| [I00074 The Tactics & Tropes of the Internet Research Agency](../../generated_pages/incidents/I00074.md) | <i>“A few press investigations have alluded to the [Russia’s Internet Research Agency]’s job ads. The extent of the human asset recruitment strategy is revealed in the organic data set. It is expansive, and was clearly a priority. Posts encouraging Americans to perform various types of tasks for IRA handlers appeared in Black, Left, and Right-targeted groups, though they were most numerous in the Black community. They included:<br> <br>- Requests for contact with preachers from Black churches (Black_Baptist_Church) <br>- Offers of free counsellingcounseling to people with sexual addiction (Army of Jesus) <br>- Soliciting volunteers to hand out fliers <br>- Soliciting volunteers to teach self-defense classes <br>- Offering free self-defense classes (Black Fist/Fit Black) <br>- Requests for followers to attend political rallies <br>- Requests for photographers to document protests <br>- Requests for speakers at protests <br>- Requests to protest the Westborough Baptist Church (LGBT United) <br>- Job offers for designers to help design fliers, sites, Facebook sticker packs <br>- Requests for female followers to send photos for a calendar <br>- Requests for followers to send photos to be shared to the Page (Back the Badge) <br>- Soliciting videos for a YouTube contest called “Pee on Hillary” <br>- Encouraging people to apply to be part of a Black reality TV show <br>- Posting a wide variety of job ads (write for BlackMattersUS and others) <br>- Requests for lawyers to volunteer to assist with immigration cases”</i> <br><br> This behaviour matches T0097.106: Recruiter Persona because the threat actors are presenting tasks for their target audience to complete in the style of a job posting (even though some of the tasks were presented as voluntary / unpaid efforts), including calls for people to attend political rallies (T0126.001: Call to Action to Attend). |
