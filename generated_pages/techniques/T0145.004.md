# Technique T0145.004: Scenery Account Imagery

* **Summary**: Scenery or nature used in account imagery.<br><br> An influence operation might flesh out its account by uploading account imagery (e.g. a profile picture), increasing its perceived authenticity.<br><br> People sometimes legitimately use images of scenery as their profile picture, and threat actors can mimic this behaviour to avoid the risk of detection associated with stealing or AI-generating profile pictures (see T0145.001: Copy Account Imagery and T0145.002: AI-Generated Account Imagery).<br><br> This Technique is often used by Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour accounts (CIBs). A collection of accounts displaying the same behaviour using similar account imagery can indicate the presence of CIB.

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA15
