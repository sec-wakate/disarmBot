# Counter C00162: Unravel/target the Potemkin villages

* **Summary**: Kremlin’s narrative spin extends through constellations of “civil society” organisations, political parties, churches, and other actors. Moscow leverages think tanks, human rights groups, election observers, Eurasianist integration groups, and orthodox groups. A collection of Russian civil society organisations, such as the Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Humanitarian Cooperation, together receive at least US$100 million per year, in addition to government-organized nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), at least 150 of which are funded by Russian presidential grants totaling US$70 million per year.
